---

## Feature Engineering Strategy

### Philosophy

Feature engineering transforms raw data into representations that better capture the underlying patterns. For BPM prediction, this involves creating features that represent musical characteristics and patterns.

### Statistical Aggregation Features

#### Row-wise Statistics
- **Mean**: Average value across all features for each record
- **Standard Deviation**: Variability/spread of features per record
- **Maximum**: Highest feature value per record
- **Minimum**: Lowest feature value per record
- **Range**: Difference between max and min (captures spread)
- **Median**: Middle value (robust to outliers)

**Rationale**: These statistics capture overall patterns in the feature space that may correlate with tempo. For instance, high variability might indicate rhythmic complexity.

### Interaction Features

#### Pairwise Interactions
- **Products**: Multiply pairs of features (captures non-linear relationships)
- **Sums**: Add pairs of features (captures combined effects)
- **Ratios**: Divide features (captures relative relationships)

**Selection Strategy**: Focus on features with highest correlation to target variable to reduce dimensionality while maintaining predictive power.

**Rationale**: Music features often interact in complex ways. For example, the combination of energy and tempo might be more predictive than either alone.

### Polynomial Features

#### Higher-Order Terms
- **Squared Terms**: Capture quadratic relationships
- **Cubic Terms**: Model more complex non-linear patterns
- **Cross Products**: Three-way feature interactions

**Trade-offs**: Balance between model complexity and overfitting risk. Typically limited to 2nd or 3rd degree polynomials.

### Feature Scaling

#### Normalization Techniques
- **StandardScaler**: Zero mean, unit variance (assumes Gaussian distribution)
- **RobustScaler**: Uses median and IQR (robust to outliers)
- **MinMaxScaler**: Scales to [0,1] range (preserves zero values)

**Selection**: RobustScaler chosen as default due to potential outliers in synthetic data.

**Application**: Applied to linear models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) but not tree-based models (which are scale-invariant).

### Feature Selection Considerations

#### Dimensionality Management
- **Goal**: Reduce features while maintaining predictive power
- **Methods**: Correlation filtering, variance thresholding, recursive feature elimination
- **Balance**: More features increase model complexity but may improve accuracy

#### Domain Knowledge Integration
- **Music Theory**: BPM typically ranges 60-200, with genres clustering around specific tempos
- **Feature Relevance**: Features related to rhythm, energy, and temporal patterns likely most relevant
- **Synthetic Artifacts**: Be aware of artificial patterns from data generation process

## Modeling Approach

### Model Selection Rationale

The program implements a diverse ensemble of models to capture different aspects of the data:

### 1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

**Type**: Linear regression with penalty on coefficient magnitude

**Characteristics**:
- Handles multicollinearity well
- Shrinks coefficients but doesn't eliminate them
- Works well with scaled features
- Fast training and prediction
- Interpretable coefficients

**Hyperparameters**:
- **Alpha**: Regularization strength (default: 1.0)
- Higher alpha = more regularization = simpler model

**Use Case**: Establishes linear baseline; good when features have approximately linear relationship with target.

### 2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

**Type**: Linear regression with absolute value penalty

**Characteristics**:
- Performs automatic feature selection (drives coefficients to exactly zero)
- Produces sparse models
- Useful when many features are irrelevant
- More aggressive than Ridge in feature elimination

**Hyperparameters**:
- **Alpha**: Regularization strength (default: 0.1)
- Controls sparsity level

**Use Case**: Feature selection and interpretation; identifies most important predictors.

### 3. ElasticNet (L1 + L2 Regularization)

**Type**: Combination of Ridge and Lasso

**Characteristics**:
- Balances feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2)
- Handles correlated features better than Lasso alone
- More stable than Lasso when features are highly correlated
- Middle ground between Ridge and Lasso

**Hyperparameters**:
- **Alpha**: Overall regularization strength
- **L1_ratio**: Balance between L1 and L2 (0=Ridge, 1=Lasso, 0.5=balanced)

**Use Case**: Best of both worlds; often performs well in practice.

### 4. Random Forest Regressor

**Type**: Ensemble of decision trees

**Characteristics**:
- Captures non-linear relationships automatically
- Robust to outliers and missing values
- Provides feature importance scores
- Reduces overfitting through bootstrap aggregating (bagging)
- No need for feature scaling

**Hyperparameters**:
- **n_estimators**: Number of trees (default: 100)
- **max_depth**: Maximum tree depth (default: 15, prevents overfitting)
- **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples to split node (default: 10)
- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples in leaf (default: 4)

**Use Case**: Strong baseline for tabular data; handles feature interactions naturally.

### 5. Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Type**: Sequential ensemble of weak learners

**Characteristics**:
- Builds trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors
- Often achieves highest accuracy on tabular data
- More prone to overfitting than Random Forest
- Slower training than Random Forest
- Powerful for complex patterns

**Hyperparameters**:
- **n_estimators**: Number of boosting stages (default: 100)
- **max_depth**: Tree depth (default: 5, shallower than RF)
- **learning_rate**: Shrinkage parameter (default: 0.1, controls overfitting)

**Use Case**: Maximum accuracy; captures subtle patterns that other models miss.

### Model Training Protocol

#### For Each Model:

1. **Initialization**: Set hyperparameters and random seed
2. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate performance on multiple folds
3. **Full Training**: Train on entire training dataset
4. **Prediction**: Generate predictions on test set
5. **Storage**: Save model and predictions for ensemble

#### Training Considerations:

- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds ensure consistent results
- **Parallelization**: Use all CPU cores (n_jobs=-1) where possible
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage for large datasets
- **Time Management**: Balance model complexity with training time

---

## Evaluation Methodology

### Cross-Validation Strategy

#### K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5)

**Process**:
1. Divide training data into 5 equal folds
2. For each fold:
   - Use 4 folds for training
   - Use 1 fold for validation
   - Calculate RMSE on validation fold
3. Average RMSE across all 5 folds
4. Report mean and standard deviation

**Benefits**:
- Reduces variance in performance estimates
- Uses all data for both training and validation
- Detects overfitting (high variance across folds)
- More reliable than single train/test split

**Considerations**:
- **Shuffle**: Data randomized before splitting (prevents order bias)
- **Stratification**: Not typically needed for regression
- **Random Seed**: Fixed for reproducibility

### Performance Metrics

#### Primary Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Formula**: √(Σ(predicted - actual)² / n)

**Characteristics**:
- Same units as target variable (BPM)
- Penalizes large errors more heavily than small errors
- Differentiable (useful for optimization)
- Standard metric for regression problems

**Interpretation**:
- Lower is better
- Represents average prediction error magnitude
- Compare to baseline (mean prediction) to assess improvement

#### Secondary Metrics (for analysis):

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
- More interpretable than RMSE
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Direct average of absolute errors

**R² Score**:
- Proportion of variance explained
- Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- Independent of target scale

**Median Absolute Error**:
- Robust to outliers
- Represents typical error magnitude

### Baseline Comparison

**Simple Mean Baseline**:
- Predict same value (mean of training target) for all test samples
- Provides minimum acceptable performance
- Any model should significantly outperform this baseline

**Purpose**:
- Sanity check for model implementation
- Quantify improvement from modeling
- Detect implementation bugs (model worse than baseline)

### Model Comparison Framework

**Criteria for Model Selection**:

1. **Cross-Validation RMSE**: Primary selection criterion
2. **CV Standard Deviation**: Lower variance indicates stability
3. **Training Time**: Consider computational efficiency
4. **Prediction Speed**: Important for deployment
5. **Interpretability**: May be important for understanding
6. **Robustness**: Performance across different data subsets

**Reporting**:
- Rank models by CV RMSE
- Show improvement over baseline
- Display confidence intervals (mean ± std)
- Highlight best performing model

---

## Ensemble Strategy

### Ensemble Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Different models make different errors. By combining predictions, we can reduce overall error and improve robustness.

**Benefits**:
- **Error Reduction**: Individual model errors partially cancel out
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to data quirks or outliers
- **Generalization**: Better performance on unseen data
- **Stability**: Reduced variance in predictions

### Weighted Average Ensemble

#### Weight Calculation Method

**Inverse RMSE Weighting**:

1. For each model, obtain cross-validation RMSE
2. Calculate weight = 1 / RMSE
3. Normalize weights to sum to 1.0

**Rationale**: Better performing models (lower RMSE) receive higher weights proportionally.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
- Weight(i) = (1/RMSE(i)) / Σ(1/RMSE(j))
- Final Prediction = Σ(Weight(i) × Prediction(i))

#### Alternative Weighting Schemes

**Equal Weighting**:
- Simple average of all predictions
- No bias toward any model
- Good when models have similar performance

**Rank-Based Weighting**:
- Weights based on performance ranking
- Less sensitive to RMSE magnitude differences

**Optimized Weights**:
- Use optimization algorithm to find best weights
- Risk of overfitting to validation data
- Requires additional holdout set

### Ensemble Composition

**Diversity Considerations**:
- Include both linear and non-linear models
- Mix regularized (Ridge/Lasso) and non-regularized (RF/GB) models
- Combine parametric and non-parametric approaches

**Model Exclusion Criteria**:
- Remove models performing worse than baseline
- Exclude highly correlated predictions (redundant)
- Consider computational cost vs. marginal benefit

### Ensemble Validation

**Expected Performance**:
- Ensemble RMSE should be lower than individual models
- If not, check for implementation errors or overfitting

**Robustness Checks**:
- Compare ensemble performance across different CV folds
- Ensure ensemble doesn't dramatically overfit to validation data
